"Java"," What’s the purpose of Static methods and static variables?","When there is a requirement to share a method or a variable between multiple objects of a class instead of creating separate copies for each object, we use static keyword to make a method or variable shared for all objects."
"Java","What is data encapsulation?","Encapsulation is a concept in Object Oriented Programming for combining properties and methods in a single unit."
"Java","What is Final Keyword in Java?"," In java, a constant is declared using the keyword Final. Value can be assigned only once and after assignment, value of a constant can’t be changed."
"Java","What’s the base class in Java from which all classes are derived?","java.lang.object"
"Java","What are Java Packages?","In Java, package is a collection of classes and interfaces which are bundled together as they are related to each other."
"Java","How can we pass argument to a function by reference instead of pass by value?","In java, we can pass argument to a function only by value and not by reference."
"Java","Why Runnable Interface is used in Java?","Runnable interface is used in java for implementing multi threaded applications. Java.Lang.Runnable interface is implemented by a class to support multi threading."
"Operating System","What is demand paging?","Demand paging is referred when not all of a process’s pages are in the RAM, then the OS brings the missing(and required) pages from the disk into the RAM."
"Operating System","What are the advantages of a multiprocessor system?","With an increased number of processors, there is a considerable increase in throughput. It can also save more money because they can share resources. Finally, overall reliability is increased as well."
"Operating System","What are real-time systems?","Real-time systems are used when rigid time requirements have been placed on the operation of a processor. It has well defined and fixed time constraints."
"Operating System","What is a virtual memory?","Virtual memory is a memory management technique for letting processes execute outside of memory. This is very useful especially is an executing program cannot fit in the physical memory."
"Operating System","What is RR scheduling algorithm?","RR (round-robin) scheduling algorithm is primarily aimed for time-sharing systems. A circular queue is a setup in such a way that the CPU scheduler goes around that queue, allocating CPU to each process for a time interval of up to around 10 to 100 milliseconds."
"Operating System","State the main difference between logical from physical address space.","Logical address refers to the address that is generated by the CPU. On the other hand, physical address refers to the address that is seen by the memory unit."
"Operating System","How does dynamic loading aid in better memory space utilization?","With dynamic loading, a routine is not loaded until it is called. This method is especially useful when large amounts of code are needed in order to handle infrequently occurring cases such as error routines."
"Operating System","Differentiate internal commands from external commands.","Internal commands are built-in commands that are already part of the operating system. External commands are separate file programs that are stored in a separate folder or directory."
"Data Structures","What do you understand by a data structure?"," A data structure offers a convenient way of organizing as well as manipulating the data. Simply put, it allows the data to be used in an effective manner. There is a galore of data structures and each of them is suitable for a distinct set of applications."
"Data Structures","How does a linear data structure differ from a non-linear data structure?"," If the elements of a data structure form a sequence or a linear list then it is called a linear data structure. On the other hand, non-linear data structures are those in which the traversal of nodes is done in a non-linear way."
"Data Structures","Which data structures are used for BFS and DFS of a graph?","BFS (Breadth-First Search) of a graph uses a queue. Although DFS (Depth First Search) of a graph makes use of a stack, it can also be implemented using recursion that uses function call stack."
"Data Structures","Explain a multidimensional array.","If an array has more than two dimensions, it is called a multidimensional array. They are also called an array of arrays."
"Data Structures","What is a queue?","A queue is a form of linear structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) approach for accessing elements. Dequeue, enqueue, front, and rear are basic operations on a queue. Like a stack, a queue can be implemented using arrays and linked lists."
"Data Structures","What is the difference between NULL and VOID?"," While NULL is a value, VOID is a data type identifier. A variable assigned with a NULL value represents an empty value. The VOID is used for identifying pointers having no initial size."
"Data Structures","What do you understand by hashing?","The technique of converting a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array is known as hashing. It is possible to create associative data storage using hash tables where data indices can be found by providing the corresponding key values."
