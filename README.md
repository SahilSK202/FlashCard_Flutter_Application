# FlashCard App

## A Flashcard App in Flutter

Flashcards are a popular study tool that helps learners test and improves their memory
when learning new information. A typical flashcard has two sides, with a question
written on one side and the corresponding answer on the other side.
For instance, the card's front side may ask, "What is Flutter," the backside provides
the answer "UI framework for cross-platform application creation."
Flashcards are more likely to come as a deck (a group of several cards) that store
information in the same category. For example, learners may have different
categories, such as finance terms, fruit names or body parts, thereby having various
flashcards at hand.

## Requirement

- Load questions from a static file, ideally, a CSV file which makes updating
  questions easy.
- Render the question card in a certain order, one screen per card.
- Build the card-flipping functionality into the UI.

# Dataset

A data.csv file can be found in assets/data/data.csv which includes topics , questions and answers used in the app. That file can be modified and improved as per requirement.
